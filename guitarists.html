                    <h1>Top 3 GUITARISTS</h1>
                    <p>1. Brian May
                        <br>
                        Topping our classic rock poll and receiving more votes than any polled player, Brian’s a true pioneer of tone and one of those rare guitarists who’s instantly recognisable from a single note. 
                        <br>
                        We caught up with the Queen guitarist to talk about his influences, tone, trademark harmonies and what it means to him to be so highly regarded in the guitar community. 
                        <br>
                        But this is Mr Brian May's response to being the reigning popular champion of guitar: “I’m absolutely speechless. I’m blown away. I have to say it’s completely unexpected. Obviously I’m deeply touched that people feel that way about me. I’m not under any illusions that, technically, I’m even on the tree of great guitarists. 
                        <br>
                        “I guess this tells me that what I’ve done has affected people, and that means a great deal to me. I will never claim to be a great guitarist in the sense of, you know, a virtuoso. I guess I just try to play from my heart and that’s about it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Jimi Hendrix
                        <br>
                        Just two months after featuring Jimi on the cover of this very magazine we find ourselves talking once again about his influence. Perhaps it's no surprise. Jimi frequently tops online 'best guitarist' polls, and, so deep is his influence, there's a good chance you already use a raft of techniques and sounds he pioneered. 
                         <br>
                        It turns out you’d be in good company! Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Kirk Hammett and Ritchie Blackmore all cite Jimi as a major influence.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Jimmy Page<br>
                        The Led Zep legend on the subject of riffs<br>

                         “Well, when you think of what a riff is, it’s hypnotic and that’s going back to the blues, which is coming out of Africa. We didn’t know that at the time. Interestingly, I’ve just got a bootleg from a gig in Orlando and in between every song I’m playing all these riffs.<br>

                            Somebody played it to me and I thought, ‘Crikey, they’re really good riffs!’ They never got used again, but they just came out on the spur of the moment. It was such an inspiring time, playing with inspired people, and we were all absolutely on top of it.”<br>
