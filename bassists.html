                    <h1>Top 3 BASSISTS</h1>
                    <p>1. John Entwistle<br>
                        The clear winner in our poll was John Entwistle of The Who. Known as both Ox and Thunderfingers, Entwistle was trained on the piano and French horn before switching to the bass. He played it like a lead instrument, creating a powerful, booming sound that often overshadowed Pete Townshend's guitar playing. His solo on "My Generation" is probably the most famous bass solo in rock history. The Who have carried on since his sudden death in 2002, but their music has lacked Entwistle's thunder and been considerably weaker as a result.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Flea
                        Red Hot Chilly Peppers bassist Flea was originally inspired by bassists in the early 1980s Los Angeles punk scene, but when he got into Bootsy Collins in the mid-Eighties and tried out his "slap" style he found a signature sound. Over the years he's adopted more of a melodic touch, but he frequently funks it up like the Flea of old. In 2009 he joined forces with Thom Yorke in the supergroup Atoms for Peace, but he's currently finishing up the next Red Hot Chili Peppers album and planning a world tour.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Paul McCartney
                        Paul McCartney gets so much attention for his brilliant songwriting in The Beatles that his stunning bass playing abilities are often overlooked. But listen to any Beatles songs and focus on his deeply melodic, flawless bass parts. He took on the role reluctantly after original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe left the group and nobody else wanted to take over his instrument. He soon mastered it, but also proved adept at guitar and drums â€“ as he proved when Ringo Starr briefly quit during the making of 1968's The White Album and Paul took his place behind the kit in the studio with great ease.
